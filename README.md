SSW-322 Engineering Design VI Final Project

## Running the Project

_Prereq: make sure you have pip installed, refer to documentation [here](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) for instructions_

1. Clone this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/elenirotsides/Exchange4Students.git
```

2. Navigate into the project

```
cd Exchange4Students
```

3. Install the required packages

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Navigate into the src folder and then run the flask server

```
cd src
python main.py
```

**or**

If you have python 2 and python 3 installed, python 2 will most likely be the default (unless you've changed the default to be python 3), so you need to make sure you're using python 3 to run this application.

```
cd src
python3 main.py
```
